# PomodoroTimer
This is an HTML, CSS &amp; JS project for a Pomodoro Timer, which takes user input for the work minutes and break minutes, and then functions on its own, giving the user alerts when work and break times are over. It has no option to cut short the break or the work time, making it motivating for the user to adhere to pomodoro protocol.
